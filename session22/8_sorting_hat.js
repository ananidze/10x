/*
 * Sorting the Sorting Hat â€“ Callback Functions
 * 
 * Story:
 * The Sorting Hat at Hogwarts is about to sort new students into their houses, but it needs a helper function
 * to determine which house each student belongs to. The Sorting Hat is an old magical object, and instead of
 * choosing houses itself, it calls a separate function (a callback function) to decide where each student goes.
